Competency Demonstration Highlights

Recipients of this credential complete the following tasks and deliverables as part of their assessment activities:

    Created a design document recommending an appropriate data architecture and constructing logical and physical data models for their solution.
    Analyzed a business case to determine the objectives, requirements, and constraints for a deployment model.
    Analyzed selected data sets and described an organizational question or decision that could be addressed using the selected data set.
    Demonstrated ordinal, label, and one-hot encoding methods; and wrangled a transactional data set.
    Wrote code to manage interactions between multiple systems, such as developing Python or R scripts for REST API creation.
    Recommended an appropriate data architecture, relational or non-relational database, and performed database queries for each using data manipulation language (DML) statements or equivalent for non-relational.
    Implemented a proof-of-concept data pipleline and explained what modifications would be necessary to address business constraints and requirements in a given scenario.
    Produced and interpreted descriptive statistics, including measures of central tendency, standard deviation, and shape of a selected data set. Produced and interpreted a Market Basket Analysis on a transactional data set.
    Deployed a data product based on business requirements and planned how to monitor the deployment’s performance over time.
